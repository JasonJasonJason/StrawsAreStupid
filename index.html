Texas was developing a bona de regional cuisine.  It was an exciting time and I eagerly jumped on the bandwagon of the new Texas tastes.  As an Executive Chef for a large Texas corporation I created recipes for a wide variety of meats, game, poultry and sauces and condiments to complement them, side dishes to serve with them, and desserts. By the year 2000, I had a vast collection of well-loved recipes. Friends urged me to turn the collection into a cookbook that would be representative of the way we eat in Texas today.  The resulting book, Texas on the Plate, became a hit with the cooks of Texas.  During a year-long book tour of events and tastings I heard the same comment over and over- Wow!  You should bottle this stuff  So, after selecting some of my favorite recipes from the book and using the same quality ingredients I created several bottled versions.  The resulting products allow home cooks to serve foods with the same complex and satisfying avors I had served for many years, simply by opening a jar. I am honored each time someone tells me how much they enjoy using one of the products that originated in the pages of my book.OPEN THE BOOK TO ENTER SITEContentsThe Book that Started it all . . . . . . . .I Todays Texas Taste. . . . . . . . . . . . . .II About Us. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

XTexas food is a cuisine that has been slowly developing since the early history of the state, one based on the sum of its many ethnic parts. There was, of course, the great inuence of Hispanic cuisine, with its use of many varieties of chiles. The German culture also had a great inuence on the emerging cuisine.  The proliferation of wild game in the state added a unique avor to the pot, along with new-to-Texas Asian ingredients, a little French technique, a lot of Central and South American tastes, and the beginning of a Texas wine industry! Texas cuisine has developed into a taste thats as big, bold, and colorful as the Lone Star State itself.The Texas on the Plate® product line offers these truly Texas tastes to home cooks.

We wanted to create a sauce for enhancing the flavor of a fine, well-marbled steak (beef or bison), a rich venison backstrap, antelope or elk chops, even a good hamburger, during the grilling process.  Simply pour a bit of the sauce in a non-aluminum baking dish and sop both sides of your red meat. Put the meat on a medium-hot grill and sear both sides, then turn down the heat, or move the meat to a cooler spot over a hardwood charcoal fire, and cook to your preferred level of doneness.  While the meat is cooking, sop a little more Bodacious over it a few times.Coming SoonTEXAS ON THE PLATEPO Box 163835Austin, Texas 78746info@texasontheplate.comOffice Phone: 512-306-0044Marketing and Salesbrion@texasontheplate.com214-797-9859Research/Developmentterry@texasontheplate.comwill@texasontheplate.com512-799-5575Financekyle@texasontheplate.com--><OBJECT classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,0,0" WIDTH="1200" HEIGHT="900" id="index" ALIGN=""> <PARAM NAME=movie VALUE="index.swf"> <PARAM NAME=quality VALUE=high> <PARAM NAME=bgcolor VALUE=#000000> <EMBED src="index.swf" quality=high bgcolor=#000000  WIDTH="1200" HEIGHT="900" NAME="index" ALIGN="" TYPE="application/x-shockwave-flash" PLUGINSPAGE="http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer"></EMBED></OBJECT></BODY></HTML>
